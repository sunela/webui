Sunela Web UI
=============

This repository contains the Sunela Web User Interface.

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE. THINGS CAN AND WILL CHANGE !

The main purposes of this part of the Sunela project is to demonstrate some
proof-of-concept functionality, to gain experience with the USB stacks both in
the SDK (CherryUSB) and in the Web browser (WebUSB), and to develop a better
understanding of the requirements for a "proper" remote control interface (for
USB and, later, also Bluetooth LE.)

Known issues:
- should use bulk instead of control transfers
- lacks error handling (with recovery), everywhere
- probably neither the firmware nor this Web UI use the underlying USB stack
  correctly
- the Javascript and the use of HTML/CSS are probably quite clumsy, too
- should encrypt communication over USB (and BTLE)
- only tested with Chrome (may work with Edge and Opera, too.)

Getting started
---------------

Connect a Sunela device to your PC and unlock it. This will load the accounts
database to the device's memory, and keep it there, even when the device turns
off again. (This is, of course, undesirable behaviour. But it's handy for now.)

Load index.html from this repository into your browser:
file:///path/index.html

Press the "Connect Sunela" button. A list of devices should pop up (should
show just the one Sunela device connected), where you select the Sunela device,
and click "Connect".

The browser will then request the list of account names from Sunela, and
display them on the Javascript console.
